# ICS32 Distributed Social Platform

The ICS32 DSP client allows users to connect to a server and communicate with 
one another. Users can specify what server to connect to and save their
username, password, and all conversation history into a local DSU file on their
computer.

## Installation

You can download the files on [GitHub](https://github.com/agileflanker/ICS32-DSP/tree/011ad99631785eb452c71a19b4ba2b57fba21ca9)

## Usage

Run the a4.py file in a terminal. In the GUI, select "Settings" -> "Configure DS Server"
in the upper-left menu and configure your server and profile. Afterwards, enter the username
of contacts you'd like to message in "Settings" -> "Add Contacts."

Test modules are included to ensure the files are correctly imported. If any issues arise
during usage, run the test modules using a testing plugin.
